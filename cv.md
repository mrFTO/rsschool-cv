## About Me:

I started my career as a jurisconsult after graduating from the Faculty of Civil Law of the Smolensk Humanitarian University. This profession gave me good soft skills as the ability to quickly navigate large amounts of information, perseverance, good communication skills, the ability to "think outside the box" and quickly adapt to changing conditions and situations. In addition, an analytical mindset, determination, risk management and the ability to make quick but thoughtful decisions helps me to achieve my goals.

I enjoy learning and discovering new things. Work in the field of computer technology has become a new stage in my development and movement towards the desired life priorities.

To start in this direction, I chose the profession of Front-End Web-Developer.

I like to create something new and see the result of my actions already in the process of work. I am good at teamwork and can work on my own. I also have the skills of time management, goal setting and a retrospective analysis of my actions, with the aim of constantly growing and moving forward.
